# Nixos config


Based on the nice [nix-starter-config](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs) from Misterio77.

This is my personal nixos configuration. Primarily it contain a laptop configuration with:

- [Home manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) - User space system management.
- [Sway](https://swaywm.org/) - Tiling window manager for wayland compositor?
- Gnome - To help when I struggle with gnome-specific tools
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) - Terminal with unicorn features
- [Startship](https://starship.rs/) - Ultra customizable

And many other tools.
